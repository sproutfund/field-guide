Complex problems require collaborative solutions. To help people collaborate effectively, we believe in designing experiences that provoke discussion, spark insight, and forge lasting partnerships. We endeavor to create intentional arcs of activity that mobilize people to work together to achieve shared goals.

For us, the core of community building is **experience design**: the work of developing regular, ongoing, engaging, in-person experiences. We believe in the power of sitting across from someone and engaging in meaningful dialogue. Digital experiences are valuable, but we’re partial to face-to-face get-togethers. Such events, when done well, foster productive, trusting relationships that enable people to collaborate intentionally and effectively over time.

We think that the most effective experiences make the most of participants’ time together. We embrace unexpected collaborations. We value openness, which means sharing ideas, showing your work, and inviting contributions from others. We insist on recruiting diverse participants and we employ high-quality facilitators who help push the work forward.

GRAY BOX: We never want people to feel unwelcome, unaware, or unclear. Rather, we want people to feel included, prepared, and informed. Which is why we seek to design accessible, engaging, and action-oriented experiences.  

Sprout has hosted hundreds of small- and large-scale events, from focus groups to multi-day festivals. While each event has its own goals and character, all Sprout events are guided by a series of principles that embody our comprehensive approach to experience design.

## Sprout’s Experience Design Principles

* **Inclusive**: Experiences should be community-based and accessible to all who want to participate.

* **Purposeful**: Experiences should be imbued with intent. Don't host a meeting that should have been an email.

* **Contextual**: Experiences should honor history, acknowledge prior work, and be clearly situated in place and time.

* **Participatory**: Experiences should be participatory and interactive, and utilize co-design whenever possible.

* **Catalytic**: Experiences should create tangible after-effects that activate community members.

* **Well-Documented**: Experiences should generate shareable artifacts, including photos, videos, and other archival material.

Applying human capacity and ingenuity to complex problems is our best hope against the robotic uprising. But solutions to such problems rarely emerge organically; they require cultivation and a structured approach for orchestrating the chaos and determining the best path forward. Active, intentional community building creates the conditions for individuals to build strong relationships with one another and form coalitions that can accelerate the pace of change.


## About the Community Building Field Guide

The Community Building Field Guide was developed by the Community Building team of The Sprout Fund.

From 2001 to 2018, The Sprout Fund was an innovative nonprofit organization based in Pittsburgh dedicated to solving problems, sharing knowledge, and seeding change.

Sprout sunset its work in June 2018. As part of the organization’s final chapter, Sprout staff documented the organization’s 17-year history through the publication of two field guides: the Catalytic Funding Field Guide, documenting Sprout’s legacy as a leading grassroots grantmaker, and this guide, which details Sprout’s work facilitating meaningful community connections. We’re grateful for the support of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which provided for the staff time and expenses necessary to complete this long-desired organizational project.

## Community Building Defined

The Sprout Fund helped foundations, nonprofits, companies, and governments make an impact on the issues they cared about most. Sprout began its work primarily as a grantmaking organization: over its 17-year history, Sprout worked with regional and national philanthropic partners to make more than $7 million of community-decided investments in more than 1,100 early-stage projects, organizations, innovators, and activities.

But giving out grants was only the beginning. In addition to providing catalytic funding to promising projects, Sprout has also spent the last decade forging connections between people working in service of critical social causes like education, art, and neighborhood development. Our experience suggests that most problems cannot be solved in isolation; instead, we believe that positive change results when people openly collaborate to achieve shared goals.

We think the best description for this body of work is **community building**: the process of creating or enhancing connections among individuals within a specific geography or interest area. The people who lead this type of work are **community builders**: the advocates who use open practices to catalyze civic action.

This publication seeks to share what our experience has taught us about the field of community building as we see it. It documents our approach to helping communities collaborate to address their own challenges, and it highlights stories of other community builders we admire whose work has had similar positive impact.

## Who Should Use This Guide

At Sprout, we’ve been lucky to work with other grantmakers, local governments, nonprofit organizations, schools, startups, community organizers, and more. The common thread among these many "friends of Sprout" has been their commitment to fostering connections in communities and contexts around the world. You can see ten examples of other “community builders” in the Voices From The Field chapter of this guide, and you’ll note that our own examples are drawn from Sprout’s work across a variety of fields over the organization’s two-decade history.

We hope you’ll use these stories, examples, and ideas as the starting point for your own community building work, no matter where you work or what you do. Moreover, we hope that the ideas and examples we’ve shared here will help other communities achieve their own measures of meaningful, positive change. _Read on!_
